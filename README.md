# Enviroment Toggle

Very simple Chrome extension. Just toggle between Production and Development urls by using a keyboard shortcut.

## Usage

In any development or production url just press `Ctrl + Shift + U` (`Cmd + Shift + U` if you're using Mac). The current url will change to production if you were on a local path and viceverse.
